# What is the Program?
An Adaptive Roguelike is a game of the roguelike genre where the player is spawned inside a dungeon in which they have to traverse through to reach the boss room. Once the player has defeated the boss inside the boss room, they can move onto the next level to gain a higher score.

Whilst this is happening, the game tracks the player, per room, on statistics such as damage taken from enemies and time taken to complete the room. These statistics are used to adapt the contents inside the room to make the game easier, for players who are findng the game difficult, and harder, for more experienced players. This is to provide a player experience that can be accessible to more people.
